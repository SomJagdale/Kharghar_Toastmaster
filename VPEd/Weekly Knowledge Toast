In previous toasts, we explored what it means to be a Distinguished Toastmaster and the criteria for achieving this title. Today, we will shift our focus to understanding what it takes for a club to earn the title of Distinguished Club.

The 10 goals of the Distinguished Club Program (DCP) are categorized into four groups:

1. **Education:**
   - Achieve four Level 1 awards.
   - Achieve two Level 2 awards.
   - Achieve two more Level 2 awards.
   - Achieve two Level 3 awards.
   - Achieve one Level 4, Path Completion, or DTM award. (The club will achieve Distinguished status.)
   - Achieve one more Level 4, Path Completion, or DTM award.

2. **Membership:**
   - Add four new, dual, or reinstating members. (The club will achieve Select Distinguished status.)
   - Add four more new, dual, or reinstating members.

3. **Training:**
   - Ensure that a minimum of four club officer roles are trained during each of the two training periods. (The club will achieve President Distinguished status.)

4. **Administration:**
   - Submit on-time payment of membership dues along with the names of at least eight members.
