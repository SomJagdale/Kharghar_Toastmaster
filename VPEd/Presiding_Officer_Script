Before we dive in, I would like to touch base and see how everyone is doing. How are you all?

We have a wonderful meeting planned with several prepared speeches and their evaluations. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize any guests we have with us today.

I would like to invite our guests to come forward. You each have one minute to introduce yourselves. Please share your name, where you're located in Navi Mumbai, the reason you decided to join our club, and how you heard about us.
Thank you for joining us! We hope you enjoy the meeting and consider becoming a member of our club.
I have couple of positive news with you all

1st one, about recent training, Senior Toastmasters can correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know, for the first time in the history of KTMC Toastmasters, 11 members were trained last week in TLTP, and 2 more will complete their training tomorrow. This means a total of 13 team members will have received training from the Toastmasters Leadership Training Program (TLTP). For our guests, TLTP is a program where members receive training for their leadership roles.

Today, we have a special session called 'Moments of Truth,' where we essentially audit and evaluate our club. We will discuss what the club is doing well and where we need improvements.

In our next meeting, we will have an educational session on the context of evaluation speeches. Toastmaster Joane from the Palava club is ready to lead this session.

Without further ado, let's get the ball rolling by welcoming our Toastmaster of the day.
