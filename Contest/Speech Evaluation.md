When evaluating a speech in a contest, it's essential to provide constructive feedback that is both encouraging and helpful for the speaker's growth. 
Here are some key points to consider while evaluating a speech:

### **1. Content:**
- **Clarity of Purpose:** Assess whether the speaker clearly communicated the main idea or purpose of their speech. Did the speech have a clear message or objective?
- **Structure and Organization:** Evaluate the structure of the speech. Was there a logical flow from introduction to conclusion? Did the speech have a clear beginning, middle, and end?
- **Relevance and Depth:** Consider whether the content was relevant to the topic and audience. Did the speaker provide sufficient depth and insight into the topic? Was the speech informative, persuasive, or entertaining?
- **Originality and Creativity:** Note the originality of the ideas presented. Did the speaker bring a unique perspective or use creative examples and anecdotes?

### **2. Delivery:**
- **Vocal Variety:** Pay attention to the speaker's use of vocal variety, including pitch, pace, volume, and tone. Did the speaker use their voice effectively to enhance the speech?
- **Body Language:** Observe the speaker's body language, including gestures, facial expressions, and movement. Did the speaker's body language complement the speech and convey confidence and enthusiasm?
- **Eye Contact:** Evaluate the speaker's eye contact with the audience. Did they engage the audience by looking around the room or focusing on individuals? Was the eye contact natural and inclusive?
- **Posture and Poise:** Assess the speaker's posture and overall presence on stage. Did they appear confident and comfortable? Did they maintain good posture throughout the speech?
- **Use of Space:** Consider how the speaker used the stage or speaking area. Did they move purposefully, or were movements distracting?

### **3. Language:**
- **Word Choice:** Evaluate the speaker's choice of words. Was the language appropriate for the audience and the purpose of the speech? Were there any particularly vivid or memorable phrases?
- **Grammar and Pronunciation:** Note the correctness of grammar and pronunciation. Were there any errors that distracted from the speech?
- **Clarity and Simplicity:** Consider whether the speaker used clear and simple language to convey their message effectively. Was the speech easy to understand?

### **4. Engagement:**
- **Audience Connection:** Assess how well the speaker connected with the audience. Did they engage the audience's emotions or make them think? Did they use humor or ask rhetorical questions effectively?
- **Use of Stories and Examples:** Note the use of stories, examples, or anecdotes to illustrate points. Were they relevant and compelling? Did they help to reinforce the speech's message?

### **5. Overall Effectiveness:**
- **Impact:** Consider the overall impact of the speech. Was it memorable? Did it leave a lasting impression? Did the speech achieve its intended effect (e.g., inspire, persuade, entertain)?
- **Adherence to Time:** Check whether the speaker adhered to the time limit. Did they manage their time effectively, or did the speech feel rushed or unfinished?

### **6. Specific Criteria for the Contest:**
- **Adherence to Contest Rules:** Ensure that the speaker followed any specific rules or guidelines for the contest, such as speech format, topic restrictions, or use of props and visual aids.
- **Judging Criteria:** Familiarize yourself with the specific judging criteria for the contest. This may include weighting different aspects of the speech differently (e.g., 40% content, 30% delivery, 20% language, 10% overall impression).

### **7. Constructive Feedback:**
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Start with what the speaker did well. Highlight their strengths and what impressed you about their speech.
- **Areas for Improvement:** Offer constructive criticism on areas where the speaker could improve. Be specific and provide actionable suggestions.
- **Encouragement:** Encourage the speaker to continue developing their skills and express confidence in their ability to improve and succeed in future speeches.

By focusing on these points, you can provide a balanced and comprehensive evaluation that helps speakers understand their strengths and areas for improvement. This approach fosters a supportive environment that encourages growth and development in public speaking.
