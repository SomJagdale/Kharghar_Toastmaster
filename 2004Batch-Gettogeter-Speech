School 2004 batch speech for gettogeter happned after 20 years
1st of all very humble saprem namsaka to all the teacher, combine namaskar by bending 
Teacher has given unvaluable support to share the all student life, I believe parent give birth to us but teacher is the one who shape the life of each and every student.
We mostly bend infront of our parent and the next person is teacher. if we see someone is bending to person on stand or bus stop we withouth daubt we think they must be teacher and studnet.

Comming back to talk about my friend today I wokeup at 5am travelled 5 hours to reach here during my travel I was thinking about what to say when I get the chance to stage to share my feeling
was search for good, happy and joyfull memories but what I remembered was fight with classmets and friends, how teach beat and different situation where I suffered and paniked and hurt.
During that thought process I realised memories of suffering and learning from it tends to stay in our mind thorughout life, so if you think you are suffring for anything dont be panic
thse are the best days of your life to learn and grouw, and only this time will be remembered in your throughout the life.

when each and every student coming in to the get after 20 years is the same as before irrespecting their life in beteen and how they are succfull or failied anything. 
Today I may be succefful person working in mnc companies as a team lead but I would not be copared with some girl who might be married early and currly housewife but she might be 
raising good childer and smart educated childer those can be my boss in future so we should not compare the accomplishment of students meeting after the 20 years.
