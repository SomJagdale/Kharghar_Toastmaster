First of all, a very humble and heartfelt Namaskar to all our beloved teachers. Let's all join in a combined Namaskar by bending slightly to show our respect.

Our teachers have provided invaluable support throughout our student lives. I believe parents give birth to us, but it is the teachers who shape our lives. We often bow in front of our parents, and the next most deserving people are our teachers. If we see someone showing respect to another person at a stand or bus stop, we instinctively think they must be a teacher and a student.

Today, I want to talk about my friends and our shared journey. I woke up at 5 AM and traveled for five hours to reach here. During my journey, I was reflecting on what to say when I got the chance to speak and share my feelings. I searched my memory for happy and joyful moments, but what stood out were the fights with classmates and friends, the times teachers disciplined us, and the various situations where I felt hurt or panicked.

As I thought more about it, I realized that memories of suffering and the lessons learned from them tend to stay with us throughout our lives. So, if you think you're suffering right now, don't panic. These are the best days of your life to learn and grow. These moments will be remembered throughout your life.

Seeing each and every one of you today, 20 years later, reminds me of how we've all remained the same at heart, regardless of our successes or failures in between. Today, I might be a successful person working as a team lead in a multinational company, but that doesn't make me any more significant than a friend who might have married early and is currently a homemaker, raising wonderful, smart, and educated children who could be my bosses in the future. We should not compare the accomplishments of students meeting after 20 years.

Our reunion is not about measuring success but about celebrating our shared memories and the journey we've been on together. Each one of us has our own unique story and has contributed to the tapestry of our lives in invaluable ways.

Let's cherish this moment and celebrate our bonds that have stood the test of time.

Thank you!
