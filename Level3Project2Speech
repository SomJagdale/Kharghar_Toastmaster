The Story of the Horseman in the Swamp
There is one small story of mine, One day, as I was riding my horse peacefully through a jungle road enjoying the sun, which was along side of swamp or small lake. While enjoying that horseride, my horse saw one big bear running towards us, before I understand anything hourse ran in to that swamp, swamp basically waterlogged areas, often containing mud. the horse suddenly started sank into the soft, deep mudy waters,pulling the me down with it. I tried to get to find
some tree branches but there wasnt anything where I can take help of it. The more the horse struggled, the deeper they sank. I realised I was in a dire
 situation, the but somehow I remembered a piece of wisdom passed down through my generations: "When stuck, pull yourself up by your own hair." 
 Though it seemed absurd and impossible,I filled myself with desperation and determination, decided to give it a try. earlier I had long hair I grabbed my own hair with both hands and, with all his might, pulled upward. Miraculously, both me and the  horse began to rise out of the swamp. Slowly but surely, we emerged from that deep mudy water, eventually making their way back to solid ground.
My villagers were astonished by my story. How could a man lift himself out of the swamp by pulling on his own hair? 
I am sure all of you will not trust this story, there was no opposite force that could push me upward, but I am living example of it, you should trust me

That was not true story, it was popular imaginary story by german nobelman Baron Munchausen, where he wanted to explain paradox of defincation of knowledge.

I want to ask one basic quick question what is knowlege?
In theroy of knowlege book by Americal philosofer Roderick Chisholm
Where he addresses fundamental questions about knowledge, belief, and justification.
What do we know ?
How do we know ?
For example - the sky is blue because we see it.
            - I am in pain, I can feel it

But today I am particularly interested in the conditions under which a belief can be considered knowledge.  
t certain beliefs are self-justified or justified by themselves and serve as the foundation for other beliefs.

Eating carrots improves your eyesight.
Using coconut oil for hair will make it grow faster.

See you are trusting one these but not trusting on my real story, where I am living example

I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it is much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers that might be wrong."
I like this quote because it highlights the beauty of embracing uncertainty and the willingness to explore the unknown. It encourages a mindset of curiosity and openness, recognizing that there is value in the process of inquiry and continuous learning rather than seeking absolute certainty

For example while growing up we learved classible phyics theroum but today quantam physics challaengin theri existance like folows 
Quantum physics, or quantum mechanics, introduces concepts that significantly challenge several fundamental theories of classical physics. Here are some of the basic and popular classical physics theories that are violated or revised by quantum mechanics:

**Philosopher**: A philosopher knows they don't have all the answers and actively seeks to learn more. 
Driven by curiosity, they question what they don't understand and explore deep questions about life and existence. 
Philosophers recognize that knowledge is an ongoing journey, and they embrace the uncertainty and complexity of the unknown as part of their pursuit of wisdom.

**Originary Person**: An originary person may believe they already know enough, often relying on tradition or personal beliefs. 
This can make them less likely to question or seek new knowledge. They might stick to what they already know and avoid challenging established ideas.

Conclusion:
The day you think that you are very good leader and good communicator, that day unknowely or implicity you stop working 
on your those skills. Dont settle for mediocrity, never let good enough be good enough.
Be like philosofer
