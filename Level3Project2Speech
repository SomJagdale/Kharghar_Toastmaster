Foundation of all our knowledge
Reference - Pursuit of Wonder
I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it is much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers that might be wrong."

I like this quote because it highlights the beauty of embracing uncertainty and the willingness to explore the unknown. It encourages a mindset of curiosity and openness, recognizing that there is value in the process of inquiry and continuous learning rather than seeking absolute certainty

For example while growing up we learved classible phyics theroum but today quantam physics challaengin theri existance like folows 
Quantum physics, or quantum mechanics, introduces concepts that significantly challenge several fundamental theories of classical physics. Here are some of the basic and popular classical physics theories that are violated or revised by quantum mechanics:

**Philosopher**: A philosopher knows they don't have all the answers and actively seeks to learn more. 
Driven by curiosity, they question what they don't understand and explore deep questions about life and existence. 
Philosophers recognize that knowledge is an ongoing journey, and they embrace the uncertainty and complexity of the unknown as part of their pursuit of wisdom.

**Originary Person**: An originary person may believe they already know enough, often relying on tradition or personal beliefs. 
This can make them less likely to question or seek new knowledge. They might stick to what they already know and avoid challenging established ideas.

Conclusion:
The day you think that you are very good leader and good communicator, that day unknowely or implicity you stop working 
on your those skills. Dont settle for mediocrity, never let good enough be good enough.
Be like philosofer
