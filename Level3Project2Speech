The Story of the Horseman in the Swamp
In a remote village, there was a legendary horseman known for his bravery and skill. One day, as he was riding his horse 
through a swamp, swamp basically waterlogged areas, often containing mud, the horse suddenly sank into the soft, deep mudy 
waters,pulling the horseman down with it. The more the horse struggled, the deeper they sank. Realizing he was in a dire 
situation, the horseman remembered a piece of wisdom passed down through generations: "When stuck, pull yourself up by your 
own hair." Though it seemed absurd and impossible, the horseman, filled with desperation and determination, decided to give 
it a try. He grabbed his own hair with both hands and, with all his might, pulled upward. Miraculously, both he and the 
horse began to rise out of the swamp. Slowly but surely, they emerged from that deep mudy water, eventually making their
way back to solid ground.
The villagers were astonished by the story. How could a man lift himself out of the swamp by pulling on his own hair? 
Yet, the horseman stood as living proof of the event. He simply believed in the wisdom and acted upon it with unwavering 
conviction, defying what seemed to be the laws of nature.

Moser, Paul K. The Theory of Knowledge

I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it is much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers that might be wrong."
I like this quote because it highlights the beauty of embracing uncertainty and the willingness to explore the unknown. It encourages a mindset of curiosity and openness, recognizing that there is value in the process of inquiry and continuous learning rather than seeking absolute certainty

Quantum physics, or quantum mechanics, introduces concepts that significantly challenge several fundamental theories of classical physics. Here are some of the basic and popular classical physics theories that are violated or revised by quantum mechanics:

**Philosopher**: A philosopher knows they don't have all the answers and actively seeks to learn more. 
Driven by curiosity, they question what they don't understand and explore deep questions about life and existence. 
Philosophers recognize that knowledge is an ongoing journey, and they embrace the uncertainty and complexity of the unknown as part of their pursuit of wisdom.

**Originary Person**: An originary person may believe they already know enough, often relying on tradition or personal beliefs. 
This can make them less likely to question or seek new knowledge. They might stick to what they already know and avoid challenging established ideas.

Conclusion:
The day you think that you are very good leader and good communicator, that day unknowely or implicity you stop working 
on your those skills. Dont settle for mediocrity, never let good enough be good enough.
